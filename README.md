# Beachy


Beachy is platform aimed at incentivizing the next generation to attend beach cleanups and pick up the trash that is polluting our beaches; and to have fun doing it.

Beachy uses a Dart/Flutter front-end and a Node/JavaScript back-end hosted on Firebase. Beachy works with organizations to get their cleanups on our feed. Then our users can find out about them on their homepage stream. They can click on each event to find out more information about it, and can sign up in advance.

Once the event has started, the game begins. Users login to the beach cleanup, and as they are picking up each peice of trash they take a picture of it and select a category for it. The categories are "plastic, metal, paper, hazardous"(when users click hazardous a dialog comes up telling them not to touch it). The data is then sent to our backend. We give more detailed analysis than ever possible before by using Google's Vision API. Not only do we give the organization a picture of every single peice of trash, we tell them what kind it is, but we also classify what kind of object it is. At the end of the cleanup, the organizers will have all the information of the event, without the use of any paper.

This new approach to beach cleanups would help attract more participants, as well as give the organizers clearer, paperless data.

This would also train the next generation to associate beach cleanups with this fun experience, motivating them to continue.

More than that, this helps cleanup organizers make a big difference. One of the main strategies employeed by Santa Monica's One Swap at a Time(Environmental Organization), is lobbying companies to change their materials so they use less plastic. This data would allow groups like them to find out exactly where the trash was coming from and stop it at the source!
