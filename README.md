# Beachy

Beachy is an app that's goal is to incentivizing the next generation to pick up trash that is polluting our beaches through gamifying the experience.

Beachy uses a Flutter front-end and a ______ back-end. Beachy works by allowing organizations to post information for beach cleanups to the server. Users will then see this in they're homepage stream. They can select one to see more information or to sign up for it.

At the event, users will take pictures of the trash that they find. This will check them out using Google Cloud Service's vision machine learning. This will recognize whether it is indeed a piece of trash, and will award it's finder points. At the end of the cleanup, the organizers will have all the information of the event, without needing to use any paper.

This new approach to beach cleanups would help attract more participants, as well as help the organizers have clearer, paperless data. This would help the environment two ways. This would also train the next generation to associate beach cleanups with this fun experience, motivating them to continue.
